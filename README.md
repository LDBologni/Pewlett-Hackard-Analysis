## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to provide help to Bobby to determine the number of retiring employees per title and department. With this information the company is preparing for the inevitable "Silver Tsunami" and creating a mentorship program that will allow retirement-ready or close to retire employees to mentor the new employees.

## Results

The total count of employees that are eligible to retire is 90,398, which translates to 30.13% of the employees. The following list depicts the current status of retiring employees by title:

- 32,452 Staff. Which translates to 35.90% of the total retiting employees, 10.82% of overall employees
- 29,415 Senior Engineer. Which translates to 32.54% of the total retiting employees, 9.8% of overall employees
- 14,221 Engineer. Which translates to 15.73% of the total retiting employees, 4.74% of overall employees
- 8,047 Senior Staff. Which translates to 8.9% of the total retiting employees, 2.68% of overall employees

## Summary

The company is going through a phase where 30% of their employees is close to the age of retiring, and only 1940 (0.65%) is eligible for the mentorship program. But with the data the company can prioritize the departments that will suffer the most (higher number of retiring) and start training new employees for the future.
